# Project overview
                This Finance Tracker Application is designed to help users record and manage their income and expenses. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library for Python, allowing users to input financial entries, view, update, and delete them. Additionally, the application offers features such as displaying monthly summaries, saving and loading financial data, and toggling between dark and light modes.
